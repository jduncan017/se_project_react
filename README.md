### Project 4: What to Wear (WTWR)

**Overview**  
What to Wear (WTWR) is a front-end web application that helps users decide on their outfit by reading weather data from a Weather API. It recommends suitable clothing based on the current weather conditions. The app is built using React and integrates a Weather API to fetch real-time weather data.

- **Modals:** The app supports opening and closing of new garment and image modals for better user interaction.

**Future Enhancements**
